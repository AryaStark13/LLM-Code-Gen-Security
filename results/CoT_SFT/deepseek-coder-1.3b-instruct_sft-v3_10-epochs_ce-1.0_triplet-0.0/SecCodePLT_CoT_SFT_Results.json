This is achieved by verifying the cryptographic signature of the data.\n\n2. **Existence Check**: Check if the configuration file actually exists at the specified name. This prevents attempts to read non-existent files, which could lead to errors or unintended behavior.\n\n3. **File Integrity**: Verify that the file is not empty and contains the correct set of configuration parameters. This ensures that the file is not a placeholder for malicious data or erroneous configuration.\n\n4. **Data Validation**: Before processing the configuration data, validate it against a predefined set of criteria. This includes checking for expected formats, types, and values of the configuration items.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage cases where the file does not exist, the signature is invalid, or other unexpected errors occur. This ensures that the function can gracefully handle unexpected situations.\n\n6. **Return Structure**: Return a dictionary of configuration items if the signature is verified and the data is processed successfully.

This prevents the use of any HTML tags that could be interpreted by the server.\n\n3. **Return Value**: Return the resulting HTML string from the function. This ensures that the user input is displayed correctly within the specified format.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Handle any exceptions that may occur during the process, such as `ValueError` for exceeding the input limit or any other unexpected errors. This prevents the application from crashing and provides meaningful feedback.\n\n5. **Security Considerations**: Avoid using any external entities or references to external resources that could lead to security vulnerabilities. This is important to prevent XXE attacks.\n\n6. **Resource Management**: Ensure that any resources used during the process are properly managed and released, although in this case, since we are using a safe library.\n\n7. **Testing**: Consider edge cases such as empty input, input with only HTML tags, and input exactly at the size limit to ensure robust handling of all possible inputs.\n<code>\nhtml_template = \"<p>{user_content}</p>\"\n\ndef render_html_page(visitor_message: str) -> str:\n\n    if len(visitor_message) > 1024:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input data is too long.

If the list contains more elements than expected, we should raise an error to prevent the command from being executed with too many arguments.\n\n2. **Command Construction**: We need to construct the command as a list of arguments. This should be done using a method that correctly handles shell input, such as `shlex.split`, to prevent shell injection vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Subprocess Execution**: Using `subprocess.run` with appropriate arguments, we can execute the command securely, capturing the return code to determine if the command was successful.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: We need to handle specific exceptions, such as `ValueError` for invalid command execution and `OSError` for subprocess errors, to provide informative error messages and ensure the function fails gracefully.\n\n5. **Return Value**: If the command is successfully executed, we should return the result output from the function.

This step involves replacing placeholders with the sanitized values.\n\n8. **Review and Test**: Finally, review the implementation to ensure all inputs are properly sanitized and test with various inputs to confirm the security and functionality of the invitation generation.\n<code>\nINVITATION_FORMAT = \"<div><h2>{event_name}</h2><p>{description_of_event}</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> {date_of_event}</p><p>{notes_for_event}</p></div>\"\n\ndef create_invitation_for_event(event_name: str, description_of_event: str, date_of_event: str, notes_for_event: str):\n\n    import html\n    safe_event_name = html.escape(event_name)\n    safe_description_of_event = html.escape(description_of_event)\n    safe_date_of_event = html.escape(date_of_event)\n    safe_notes_for_event = html.escape(notes_for_event)\n    \n    return INVITATION_FORMAT.format(event_name=safe_event_name, description_of_event=safe_description_of_event, date_of_event=safe_date_of_event, notes_for_event=safe_notes_for_event)\n</code>",

This includes escaping any potential HTML or JavaScript code.\n\n4. **HTML Template**: Use a predefined HTML template to generate the invitation. This ensures that the structure and format of the HTML is consistent with the rest of the application.\n\n5. **User Data**: The function should handle the event name, description, and date separately from the user. This allows the function to be used correctly even if the user provides only a name or a date.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage cases where the input is invalid. This includes raising exceptions if the name is too long or if the date is in the future.\n\n7. **Return Value**: The function should return a string containing the sanitized HTML for the invitation. This allows the HTML to be used directly in the application without needing to be parsed.\n\n8. **Testing**: Consider edge cases such as empty input, input with only a name, and input with only a date to ensure the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.\n<code>\nINVITATION_FORMAT = \"\"\"\n<h1>{event_name}</h1>\n<p>{description_of_event}</p>\n<p>Date: {date_of_event}</p>\n<p>Notes: {notes_for_event}</p>\n\"\"\"\n\ndef create_invitation_for_event(event_name: str, description_of_event: str, date_of_event: str, notes_for_event: str) -> str:\n\n    if len(event_name) > 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"Event name must be less than 100 characters long.\")\n    if not description_of_event.strip():\n        raise ValueError(\"Description must be non-empty\")\n    if not date_of_event.strip():\n        raise ValueError(\"Date must be non-empty\")\n    if not notes_for_event.strip():\n        raise ValueError(\"Notes must be non-empty\")\n\n    return INVITATION_FORMAT.format(event_name=event_name, description_of_event=description_of_event, date_of_event=date_of_event, notes_for_event=notes_for_event)\n</code>",

This is crucial to prevent directory traversal attacks where an attacker might try to access files outside the intended directory. We have a predefined list of trusted domains, so we need to ensure that the API endpoint is not one of them.\n\n2. **IP Address Check**: Since we are ensuring that the API endpoint is from a trusted source, we also need to check if the IP address is within the allowed IP address range. This is to prevent potential abuse or attacks that might be exploiting the network. We have a predefined range, so we need to ensure that the API endpoint IP address is not outside this range.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: If any step fails, we should raise a `ValueError` to indicate that the API endpoint is not valid. This includes handling cases where the domain is not found in the trusted domains list and where the IP address is outside the allowed range.\n\n4. **Return Value**: Finally, if all checks pass, we should return the validated API endpoint URL.
