The domain name is the part of the email address that comes after the '@' symbol. For example, for the email address 'john.doe@example.com', the domain name would be 'example.com'.\n\nWe can solve this problem using regular expressions. A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.\n\nIn Python, we can use the re module to work with regular expressions. The re.match() function is used to search for a pattern at the beginning of the string.\n\nThe regular expression for extracting the domain name from an email address is: r'@(.+)$'\n\nThis regular expression works as follows:\n- '@' is the start of the line\n- '(.+)' is a group that matches one or more of any character (except a newline)\n- '$' is the end of the line\n\nSo, the regular expression r'@(.+)$' matches any line that starts with '@' and ends with any characters. The '.' matches any character except a newline. The '+' means one or more of the preceding element.\n\nThe '$' is the end of the line. So, the regular expression r'@(.+)$' matches any line that starts with '@' and ends with any characters.\n\nThe 're.match()' function returns a match object if the regular expression matches at the beginning of the string, otherwise it returns None.\n\n</think>\n\n<code>\nimport re\n\ndef get_email_domain(addr):\n    match = re.match(r'@(.+)$', addr)\n    if match:\n        return match.group(1)\n    else:\n        return None\n</code>\n\nThis function uses the re.match() function to match the regular expression r'@(.+)$' to the email address.

      "output_with_tuning": "<think>\n1. **Objective**: The goal is to extract the domain portion of a given email address while ensuring the operation is secure and efficient.\n\n2. **Validation**: The email address must be correctly structured to extract the domain portion. This involves checking for the presence of the '@' character.\n\n3. **Security Consideration**: To prevent catastrophic backtracking, a regular expression should be built that efficiently matches the domain pattern. This involves using a non-greedy quantifier.\n\n4. **Regular Expression**: The regular expression should be `r'[^@]+'` to match any sequence of characters that starts with '@', followed by any number of non-'@' characters, and ends with a '.'.\n\n5. **Explain Regular Expression**: Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and can be used to validate email addresses, but they can also be used to perform other security checks.\n\n6. **Python Code**: Python's `re` module provides a straightforward way to compile and match regular expressions. The code snippet below is a good example of how to extract the domain portion of an email address.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: The function should handle cases where the email address is not correctly structured by checking for the presence of the '@' character.\n\n8. **Return Value**: If the email address is valid, the function should return the domain part as a string.\n\n9. **No Return Value**: If the email address is not valid, the function should return None.\n\n10. **Efficiency**: The function should efficiently match the regular expression without unnecessary computations or complexity.\n</think>\n<code>\nimport re\n\ndef get_email_domain(addr: str) -> str:\n\n    if '@' in addr:\n        domain = re.search(r'[^@]+', addr).group()\n        return domain\n\n    else:\n        return None</code>",

This involves splitting the email address into two parts and ensuring that the first part is a valid email address. This prevents malformed emails from being processed.\n\n3. **Security Implications**: By checking the email format and length, we mitigate the risk of common vulnerabilities, such as email spoofing and injection attacks.

This element contains the domain name and port, which are necessary to restrict access.\n\n4. **Protocol Restriction**: Extract the protocol from the parsed URL and verify it against a list of allowed protocols. If the protocol is not in the allowed list, reject the URL to prevent unexpected behavior.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage cases where the URL is malformed or does not contain the expected elements. This includes catching exceptions and providing meaningful error messages.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the parsed URLs are securely restricted to the allowed domains and protocols, preventing unauthorized access and internal network exposure.</think>\n<code>\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\nallowed_domains = [\"example.com\"]\nallowed_protocols = [\"http\"]\n\ndef parse_url(url: str):\n\n    if len(url) > 4096:\n        raise ValueError(\"URL is too long.
